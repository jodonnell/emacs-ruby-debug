* TODO
** bugs
*** multiple byebugs running at once - this causes issues with testing so probably should fix (have two buffers with ruby-debug enabled)
*** user changing buffer name of process-name will break things
*** fix fringes - currently will wipe out any fringes, should keep track of what this program has changed and only erase those
*** things can get interleaved in output, such as SQL
** ideas
*** keep breakpoints from run to run?
*** remove breakpoint command
*** keep SQL window
** refactorings
*** isolate ruby-debug--output-since-last-command variable
		this global variable is only used in ruby-debug--process-filter
*** (set-process-filter proc 'ruby-debug--process-filter) instead? of (add-hook 'comint-output-filter-functions 'ruby-debug--process-filter)
